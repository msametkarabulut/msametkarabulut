### Hi there, I'm Samet 👋

#### **Red Team Specialist | Security Researcher | Full-Stack Exploiter**

I am a Computer Engineering student and Offensive Security Specialist who adopts the philosophy of **"breaking systems to strengthen them."** My journey started with software development, giving me the critical **"Builder's Mindset"** to understand how systems function deep down.

Currently, I focus on simulating advanced threat actors (Red Teaming), developing custom attack tools in **C#**, and performing advanced web application security assessments using my **PHP** background.

### 🚀 The "Builder & Breaker" Philosophy

Unlike many security professionals who only know how to use tools, I know **how the systems I attack are built.**

* **Why PHP?** With years of **PHP Web Development** experience, I have a deep grasp of server-side backend logic. This allows me to spot complex logic flaws that standard scanners miss, perform superior **White-box Code Reviews**, and craft custom web shells/backdoors.
* **Why C#?** I use C# to interact directly with Windows APIs, bypass EDR/Antivirus solutions, and develop custom Command & Control (C2) agents for Active Directory environments.
